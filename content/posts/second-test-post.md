### Basic Formatting

Here’s how some basic formatting works:

- **Bold Text**
- *Italicized Text*
- \~\~Strikethrough\~\~
- `Inline Code`

> This is a blockquote, useful for highlighting key information or quotes.

### Code Block Example

The following code block shows syntax highlighting with Hugo’s Chroma integration, as configured in **PaperMod**:

\`\`\`python
def hello\_world():
	print(“Hello, World!”)
