## Introduction

Welcome to the **PaperMod** theme test post! This post showcases various formatting and content styles to help you understand how different elements look on your site.

Just updating for another test.

### Basic Formatting

Here’s how some basic formatting works:

- **Bold Text**  
- *Italicized Text*  
- ~~Strikethrough~~  
- `Inline Code`

> This is a blockquote, useful for highlighting key information or quotes.

### Code Block Example

The following code block shows syntax highlighting with Hugo’s Chroma integration, as configured in **PaperMod**:

```python
def hello_world():
    print(“Hello, World!”)
