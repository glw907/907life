# _Welcome!_ :wave:

This blog exists for several reasons. First and foremost, it's an instruction manual of sorts for anybody interested in living life without the soul-sucking weight of history's most compelling attention magnet in their pocket. If you're new here, I'd suggest starting with the [How I Did It](https://907.life/how-i-did-it/) post.
 
I also use this space for occasional musings on the impact of modern digital technology on lived human experience, as well as any other long-form writing that I want to share with the online world.
